<p><strong>Bandito</strong> is a personal project of <a href="http://indrode.com/">Indro De</a>. It will grow to contain pages for personal reference, picture galleries, and writings on other nonspecific topics. You may call it a hybrid between a blog, photo gallery, reference manual, and personal shoutbox. The Bandito website will be constantly tweaked and updated while maintaining a simplistic, minimal layout. You may follow the source code on <a href="http://github.com/indrode/indrode.github.com">GitHub</a>. Eventually, I may post something about my Jekyll implementation and design philosophy.</p>
