<h1>Welcome to Bandito</h1>

<p>Bandito is a random repository of documents, websites, and writings, as well as a virtual coding playground and photo gallery. First and foremost, a tool to archive stuff of relative importance to its author and collector, Indro De, but hopefully of some relevance and interest to someone out there in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meatspace">meatspace</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace">cyberspace</a>.</p>
